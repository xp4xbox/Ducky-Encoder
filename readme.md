# Ducky Encoder
A USB Rubber Ducky Script encoder written in HTA/VBscript. Please refer to the [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/USB-Rubber-Ducky-Script-Encoder-VBScript/) for more information.

## Usage

1. If you don't already have a folder called `temp` in the root of your `C` drive, create one.

2. Install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) if you don't already have it installed.

2. Download the [duckencode.jar](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Downloads)
and place it in your `c:\temp` folder

3. Run `Duck.hta` with the two other files in the same directory, or `Duck.exe` if you are using the standalone .exe version.

4. Paste in your script or open the text file with your code. 
> This program only reads .txt files.

5. Hit Encode, and the program will encode your script to a file called `inject.bin` in `c:\temp`

6. Move `inject.bin` to your USB Rubber Ducky.
